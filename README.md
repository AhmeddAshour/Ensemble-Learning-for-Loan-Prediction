# Ensemble Learning in Machine Learning for Loan Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and compare multiple ensemble learning techniques to predict the loan status of a person based on various parameters. I used default_of_credit_card_clients.xls dataset, perform data analysis, feature extraction, and apply various ensemble learning techniques to evaluate and compare their predictive performance.

## Instructions

### 1. Dataset Selection
- **Dataset Requirements**:
  - Use your own dataset for this assignment.
  - Ensure the dataset includes sufficient features (independent variables) and a target variable (loan status) to enable classification.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualize key insights from the data.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Engineering and Extraction**:
  - Perform feature engineering to optimize model performance.
- **Normalization/Standardization**:
  - Normalize or standardize the data if required.
- **Data Splitting**:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (use an 80/20 or 70/30 split).

### 3. Ensemble Techniques

#### A. Basic Ensemble Techniques
- **Max Voting**: Implement Max Voting using multiple classifiers and compare their predictions.
- **Averaging**: Implement the Averaging method where predictions from multiple classifiers are averaged.
- **Weighted Average**: Implement Weighted Averaging where classifiers are assigned weights based on their performance.

#### B. Advanced Ensemble Techniques
- **Bagging**: Use Bagging techniques to improve model performance.
- **Boosting**: Use Boosting techniques to reduce bias and variance.
- **Stacking**: Implement Stacking using multiple base models and a meta-model.

#### C. Algorithms Based on Bagging and Boosting
1. **Bagging Meta-Estimator**: Implement BaggingClassifier for classification. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
2. **Random Forest**: Train a Random Forest Classifier and evaluate its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
3. **AdaBoost**: Implement AdaBoost with decision trees as base models. Track and report its iterative improvement.
4. **Gradient Boosting (GBM)**: Use the Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict the loan status. Tune hyperparameters for better performance.
5. **XGBoost**: Train an XGBoost Classifier. Use its built-in feature importance functionality to identify significant features.

### 4. Analysis and Comparison
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Compare the performance of each ensemble method in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Summary Table**:
  - Create a table showing the performance of all ensemble methods applied.
- **Best Technique**:
  - Identify which technique performed the best and provide reasoning for the observed performance.

### 5. Implementation

- Used Python libraries such as:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

### 6. Tools and Libraries
